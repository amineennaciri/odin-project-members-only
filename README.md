# odin-project-members-only
This is the members only application project from TOP(the odin project) Full Stack JavaScript course.

This project is about building an exclusive clubhouse app where your members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse app, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it. 

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in setting up a web app with authentication using node.js and express and a mongodb database.

Self-reflection and conclusion: This was agreat opportunity to practice setting a full stack app with authentication, node.js, express and mongodb database with mongoose.
